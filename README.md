# Chill Drone

## Description

A fully functional drone added to Risk of Rain 2. The drone slows nearby enemies with its beam.

The drone is powered by the API of **[Chen's Gradius Mod](https://github.com/cheeeeeeeeeen/RoR2-ChensGradiusMod)**.

## For Improvement
Little details for now since this drone can use an upgrade in terms of visuals. This drone fires a beam to anything it detects and applies a massive slow debuff.

## Installation

Use **[Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)** to install this mod.

If one does not want to use a mod manager, then get the DLL from **[Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/Chen/ChillDrone/)**.
